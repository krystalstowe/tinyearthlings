					<h2>What is a doula?</h2>
					<p>According to DONA International, "a doula is a trained professional who provides continuous physical, emotional, and informational support to a mother before, during, and shortly after childbirth to help her achieve the healthiest, most satisfying experience possible." Not only are doulas great for mothers but they are impmortant to the whole family.</p>
					<p>What is my definition of doula? A doula is your advocate, your backbone during the birthing process. Doulas build a relationship with you before the birth of your baby to help you feel comfortable enough to ask questions or express concerns. There are a few types of doulas. They are birth doulas, postpartum doulas, and antepartum doulas.</p>
					<p>Birth doulas provide care before and during the birthing process. They are a major part of the birthing team. Their main job is to provide hands-on support and comfor for labor and delivery. Postpartum doulas are different. They enter the picture after the baby arrives and provide support for a few hours or the first three months. Postpartum doulas focus mainly on the mother, making sure she is fed, healing, bonding with her baby, and adapting to motherhood smoothly. This doula's role is to take care of you, the mother. Antepartum douls help women who are experiencing high-risk or difficult pregnancies. Tiny Earthlings focused on postpartum care.</p>
